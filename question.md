dstack: Technical Writer Test Assignment (A)

This test assignment is aimed at assessing how the candidate is capable of learning new frameworks and quickly creating code samples and educational tutorials that help get started with these frameworks.

Task 1: Create a code sample that uses PyTorch Lightning and dstack to train a simple model

Prerequisites:

Create an account with dstack.ai and send Andrey Cheptsov the name of the user
Andrey Cheptsov will configure for your dstack account the AWS credentials and on-demand limits so you can run dstack workflows.
Be sure to read through the dstack documentation to understand how it works and ask questions if anything is not clear

Requirements:

Itâ€™s allowed to use one of the existing examples provided by PyTorch Lightning from their documentation or repository (e.g. MNIST). You just need to adapt it to run with dstack.
The sample should allow running the training workflow without GPU, with a single GPU, and with multiple GPU. For example, you can use a dstack variable to control it.
Be sure to check that the training actually works in all cases (with a single GPU, with multiple GPUs, and with no GPUs).

Task 2: Create a blog post that walks the user through the steps of using PyTorch Lightning and dstack to train a simple model

Requirements:

Feel free to reuse the code from the sample that you prepared with Task 1.
